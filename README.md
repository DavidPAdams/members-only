# Members-Only Clubhouse

An exercise to build authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site for
which they are authorized. As part of the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)

## Objective

Build an exclusive clubhouse applicaatio where members can write 'embarrassing' stories
about non-members. In the application, members can read stories and see the author's name,
however, non-members can only read stories and wonder who wrote them.

The poin of the project is to build my own authentication system. As such, styling is less
of a consideration. There will be some basic bootstrap styling, but don't expect much. ;)
